Hi Wenjing and Prof. Papautsky, I hope you are able to find this easily.

This is my first time using Git and Github, which are often used to
facilitate collaboration on software projects. It will be useful for
us for three reasons:

  (1) you two can easily see what changes I am making to help track
      my progress with the software,
  (2) creates an online backup of the code, and
  (3) allows me to program from different computers.

Right now I am working on an ODS class, which will help the program
open and save open document spreadsheet files. These can be opened
and edited in Excel. This will be useful for importing test parameters
from a file and for saving data files.

ODS files are much simpler than .XLSX files but they are still not
pretty. First, a single .ODS file actually contains multiple files
that are all zipped together and compressed. So the first step for
reading and editing them is decompression and unzipping. If you want
to see this for yourself, try this:

  (1) open up a new file in excel and type in a few cells. Save it
      with an .ods extension.
  (2) in file explorer, rename the file from "something.ods" to
      "something.zip".
  (3) finally, you can open this file with whatever zip program
      your PC has by default. Usually it is peazip or 7zip. This will
      show you all of the files that make up and ODS when it is
      uncompressed.

So this is the problem I am currently solving. After I complete this
class, I can integrate it pretty quickly into the main program.
